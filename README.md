# Password Generator and Hasher

This Python script allows you to generate a list of strong passwords by combining base words and applying various transformations. It also computes SHA1 hashes for these passwords and saves the results to text files.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the script.

2. Ensure you have Python installed (recommended version: Python 3).

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.


4. Follow the on-screen prompts to input base words, select transformation options, and specify the number of password combinations to generate.

5. The script will then compute strong passwords based on your input and save them to a text file.

6. The script will also compute SHA1 hashes for the generated passwords and save them to another text file.

## Usage

- The script will prompt you to enter base words. You can input one word per line and type 'done' when finished.

- You can select various transformation options, such as adding numbers, symbols, capitalizing letters, or replacing characters in the base words.

- Specify the number of password combinations you want to generate.

- You can provide custom filenames for both the input (passwords) and output (password hashes) text files.
